Front End Capstone: Daily planner

What does the Daily planner do? The Daily planner will allow users to use an app instead of a bulky paper planner to keep track of all of the things you would normally see in a day planner. It will keep basic information about tasks, appointments, vehicle maintenance and an address book all in one place. It will allow the user to create an account and use the tools in the app to organize their month and week.

MVP:

The planner will have a month at a glance view and a weekly view.

The weekly view will have link to the to do list that will also show up on the monthly view. All entries can be edited and deleted.

The to do list will list the most immediate tasks first and the current day's tasks a different color.
